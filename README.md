## 📈 Key Insights (From PPT)
- **Mid-Range listings dominate** across all BHK categories, indicating a strong middle-income buyer base.
- **High-End listings show steep price growth per square foot**, especially beyond 2,200 sqft.
- **Neighborhood (Urban vs Rural)** has minimal impact on pricing – property features matter more.
- **Long-term trends show volatility**, particularly post-2000 – highlighting sensitivity to macroeconomic events.
- **Market concentration** is heavily skewed toward Urban + Mid-Range, with potential in Urban Luxury gaps.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
- Prioritize mid-range housing inventory
- Explore compact luxury development in urban areas
- Build pricing models based on property attributes, not geography
- Watch economic cycles for long-term pricing strategy
